# Engine Architecture

This document describes the engine layout, the pipeline lifecycle, and
the contracts between components. For source-/destination-side schema
details see [`source-config.md`](source-config.md) and
[`destination-config.md`](destination-config.md).

**Scope:** this doc owns the streaming engine — extract / transform /
load / checkpoint orchestration, the producer/consumer flow, the
dual-mode (`RUN_MODE`) runner, and how the engine consumes the CDK and
connections. It defers elsewhere for: destination handler config
([`destination-config.md`](destination-config.md)); the gRPC protocol /
wire format ([`grpc-streaming-architecture.md`](grpc-streaming-architecture.md));
the Arrow type system ([`pyarrow-and-destinations.md`](pyarrow-and-destinations.md));
the CDK boundary / contract
([`connector-module-architecture.md`](connector-module-architecture.md));
and source / stream config ([`source-config.md`](source-config.md)).

## Module Layout

Shared connector machinery lives in the **CDK** package (`cdk/cdk/`,
imported as `from cdk.<x> import ...`). The engine (`src/`) consumes it.
See [`connector-module-architecture.md`](connector-module-architecture.md)
for the CDK boundary in full.

```

The engine has zero cloud SDK dependencies. State, logs, DLQ, and
metrics use the local filesystem and stdout; downstream ingestion by an
external log/metrics shipper is a deployment concern, not an engine concern.

### Incremental state restore

An incremental stream's resume cursor is written two ways: to the local
`state/{pipeline_id}/{stream_id}.json` checkpoint, and to an
`ANALITIQ_STATE` stdout log line the external shipper harvests into durable
storage. On a fresh container (each task starts with an empty `state/`) the
local checkpoint is gone, so restore reads the `RESUME_STATE` environment
variable instead — a JSON object `{stream_id: cursor}` the deployment
injects from whatever it harvested off the prior run. `StateManager` seeds
its cursor cache from it at startup (`src/state/store.py:parse_resume_state`,
`src/state/state_manager.py`). This keeps restore symmetric with emission:
the engine never reaches for cloud storage itself, it only consumes a
resolved value the deployment supplies — exactly as it does for secrets and
config. A resume reads strictly past the last committed high-water mark
(exclusive `>`), so a no-change re-run re-emits no rows; a non-unique cursor
(e.g. a coarse timestamp with ties) should pair with `upsert` so a late row
sharing the boundary value is not skipped.

## Pipeline Lifecycle

1. `src.main` reads `RUN_MODE`. `source` runs the pipeline engine;
   `destination` runs the gRPC destination server (see
   [`grpc-streaming-architecture.md`](grpc-streaming-architecture.md)).
2. `PipelineRunner` (`src/runner.py`) instantiates `PipelineConfigPrep`,
   which:
   - discovers project root by locating `pipelines/manifest.json`,
   - finds the manifest entry matching `PIPELINE_ID` (must be `active`),
   - loads `pipeline.json` and per-stream files,
   - loads each `connection.json` + its connector definition,
   - builds a `ConnectionRuntime` per connection (with a per-connection
     secrets resolver),
   - resolves every `endpoint_ref` to its endpoint JSON.
3. `PipelineRunner` (`src/runner.py`) translates the resolved contract
   objects into a flat config dict via `_build_config_dict` (and its
   source/destination translation helpers), then constructs a
   `StreamingEngine` with runtime tuning parameters from the pipeline
   config and calls `engine.stream_data(config_dict)`.
4. `StreamingEngine` orchestrates multi-stream execution directly in
   `stream_data`. Each stream runs four async stages —
   `_extract_stage -> _transform_stage -> _load_stage ->
   _checkpoint_stage` — wired together with async queues. The transform
   stage uses `AssignmentTransformer` for the assignment AST.
5. `_load_stage` streams batches over gRPC to the destination service
   with batch-level idempotency (protocol in
   [`grpc-streaming-architecture.md`](grpc-streaming-architecture.md)).
6. Metrics snapshots are emitted to logs as `ANALITIQ_METRICS::{...}`
   lines (batch-level from the engine, pipeline-level from the runner)
   and final pipeline metrics are persisted via
   `state.metrics_storage.save_pipeline_metrics`.

## Exception Hierarchy

Defined in `src/engine/exceptions.py`:

```
StreamProcessingError                   (base for runtime stream failures)
├── TransformationError
├── ConnectorError
└── StreamExecutionError                (carries stage + batch context)

ConfigurationError                      (base for config-time failures)
├── StreamConfigurationError
├── PipelineValidationError
└── StageConfigurationError
```

Concurrent stream failures are aggregated with Python 3.11+
`ExceptionGroup` and consumed in callers via `except*`.

```python
try:
    await engine.stream_data(pipeline_config)
except* StreamProcessingError as eg:
    for exc in eg.exceptions:
        logger.error("stream failed: %s", exc)
except* Exception as eg:
    for exc in eg.exceptions:
        logger.error("unexpected error: %s", exc)
```

## ConnectionRuntime and Transports

Each connection loaded by `PipelineConfigPrep` becomes a
`ConnectionRuntime` (`cdk/cdk/connection_runtime.py`). The runtime:

- Holds the resolved connector definition and the user's connection
  document.
- Requires `connector_type` to be a non-empty string. Which kinds are
  runnable is decided by the worker registry (`cdk/cdk/registry.py`),
  not by a hard-coded set, so registry-discovered connector kinds are
  not blocked at config time.
- When the connector declares a `transports` block, builds the actual
  transport (SQLAlchemy async engine, aiohttp ClientSession, etc.) via
  `cdk/cdk/transport_factory.py`. The factory drives:
  - `_materialize_derived` — fixpoint-evaluates the connector's
    `derived` block.
  - `_ssl_dict_to_context` — builds an `ssl.SSLContext` from declarative
    `{verify_mode, check_hostname}` dicts (CPython-safe ordering).
  - `build_sqlalchemy_transport` and `build_http_transport` — assemble
    the final transport, rejecting half-specified `rate_limit` shapes.
- Reference-counts handles so multiple streams sharing a connection
  share the same engine / session.

Expression resolution (`ref`, `template`, `literal`, `function`) is
provided by `cdk/cdk/resolver.py`; the `function` registry is in
`cdk/cdk/derived_functions.py` (`lookup`, `basic_auth`,
`base64_encode`, `url_encode`).

## Source Connector Layer

`BaseConnector` lives in `src/source/connectors/base.py`. The only
engine-side concrete implementation is `APIConnector`
(`src/source/connectors/api.py`) — it handles cursor / offset / page /
time-window pagination, incremental replication with safety windows and
tie-breaker deduplication, rate limiting, and retry / backoff via
state-layer helpers.

Database sources and destinations are unified in the CDK as
`GenericSQLConnector` (`cdk/cdk/sql/generic.py`), a single class that
implements four capability Protocols from `cdk/cdk/contract.py`
(`Readable` / `Writable` / `Discoverable` / `TableCreator`) and serves
both SQLAlchemy and ADBC transports. The standalone `DatabaseConnector`
and the per-dialect `src/source/drivers/` classes no longer exist. See
[`connector-module-architecture.md`](connector-module-architecture.md)
for the full CDK contract.

## Connector Registries

Connector classes are resolved through `ConnectorRegistry`
(`cdk/cdk/registry.py`), constructed by `build_registries(...)`. There
is no `HandlerRegistry`.

- The engine builds a **source** registry in `src/engine/engine.py`
  (`self._source_registry, _ = build_registries(...)`) and instantiates
  a stream's source via `self._source_registry.create(connector_type)`.
- The **destination** side builds its registry in
  `src/destination/connectors/__init__.py`, exporting
  `destination_registry` and the `get_handler(connector_type)` helper.
  Built-ins map `database -> GenericSQLConnector`, `api`, `file` / `s3`,
  and `stdout`. Externally installed connector packages register
  themselves through the `analitiq.destination_connectors` entry-point
  group.

## Structured Logging

`StreamingEngine` uses structured logging with correlation IDs. The engine
stamps each log with the `run_id` so batches and stream events are joinable
downstream.

```text
... INFO  src.engine.engine.wise-to-postgresql - Starting pipeline: wise-to-postgresql
... INFO  src.engine.engine.wise-to-postgresql - Processing stream: wise-transfers
       {"stream_id": "wise-transfers", "correlation_id": "..."}
```
