# Engine Architecture

This document describes the engine layout, the pipeline lifecycle, and
the contracts between components. For source-/destination-side schema
details see [`source-config.md`](source-config.md) and
[`destination-config.md`](destination-config.md).

**Scope:** this doc owns the streaming engine — extract / transform /
load / checkpoint orchestration, the producer/consumer flow, the
dual-mode (`RUN_MODE`) runner, and how the engine consumes the CDK and
connections. It defers elsewhere for: destination handler config
([`destination-config.md`](destination-config.md)); the gRPC protocol /
wire format ([`grpc-streaming-architecture.md`](grpc-streaming-architecture.md));
the Arrow type system ([`pyarrow-and-destinations.md`](pyarrow-and-destinations.md));
the CDK boundary / contract
([`connector-module-architecture.md`](connector-module-architecture.md));
and source / stream config ([`source-config.md`](source-config.md)).

## Module Layout

Shared connector machinery lives in the **CDK** package (`cdk/cdk/`,
imported as `from cdk.<x> import ...`). The engine (`src/`) consumes it.
See [`connector-module-architecture.md`](connector-module-architecture.md)
for the CDK boundary in full.

```

The engine has zero cloud SDK dependencies. State, logs, DLQ, and
metrics use the local filesystem and stdout; downstream ingestion by an
external log/metrics shipper is a deployment concern, not an engine concern.

### Incremental state restore

An incremental stream's resume cursor is written two ways: to an
`ANALITIQ_STATE` stdout log line the external shipper harvests into durable
storage (cloud), and to a **per-stream checkpoint file**
`state/{pipeline_id}/{stream_id}.json` = `{"cursor": <value>}`
(`CursorStore`, via `StateManager.save_stream_checkpoint`). Each stream owns its
own file and writes it on **every destination ACK**, so concurrent streams never
contend on a shared file and a crash loses at most the last un-ACKed batch.

The stored value is the **committed (destination-ACKed) high-water mark** —
never the source's pre-ACK position (the source advances its cursor as it yields
batches, ahead of the ACK). `save_cursor`, which relays that pre-ACK position
from the source worker, updates only the in-run cache and is never persisted. So
a stream that failed or never ACKed a batch resumes from its last safe bookmark
instead of skipping rows that never landed, and a stream with no checkpoint
resumes with a full re-scan.

Restore is lazy: `get_cursor` reads a stream's checkpoint file at the start of
its run (`src/state/store.py:CursorStore`, `src/state/state_manager.py`). The
two delivery paths converge on the same files: in the cloud each task starts
with an empty `state/`, so the deployment delivers the per-stream files in the
config bundle from whatever it harvested off the prior run; locally the files
the prior run wrote are read directly. Either way the engine only reads resolved
local files and never reaches for cloud storage — exactly as it does for secrets
and config. Delivering the cursors as bundle files rather than an env var also
keeps a high-stream-count pipeline clear of any size limit the deployment
imposes on a task's launch parameters.

Each cursor carries its type. A `datetime`/`date` travels as a tagged
`{"__type__": ..., "value": ...}` value — the same form the on-disk checkpoint
and the gRPC cursor token use — so a timestamp cursor comes back as a
`datetime` (asyncpg rejects a plain string for a timestamp bind) and a string
cursor whose value looks like a date stays a string. The type is carried
end-to-end, never guessed from a value's shape.

A resume reads inclusively (`>=`) from the last committed high-water mark, so
the boundary row is re-read. This keeps a non-unique cursor lossless: a row
that arrives at the boundary value between runs is still read, where an
exclusive `>` would filter it out at the source and drop it. The default
`upsert` write mode dedups the re-read against its `conflict_keys`; an `insert`
stream re-reading the boundary fails loud on the duplicate key rather than
silently losing rows.

## Pipeline Lifecycle

1. `src.main` reads `RUN_MODE`. `source` runs the pipeline engine;
   `destination` runs the gRPC destination server (see
   [`grpc-streaming-architecture.md`](grpc-streaming-architecture.md)).
2. `PipelineRunner` (`src/runner.py`) instantiates `PipelineConfigPrep`,
   which:
   - discovers project root by locating `pipelines/manifest.json`,
   - finds the manifest entry matching `PIPELINE_ID` (must be `active`),
   - loads `pipeline.json` and per-stream files,
   - loads each `connection.json` + its connector definition,
   - builds a `ConnectionRuntime` per connection (with a per-connection
     secrets resolver),
   - resolves every `endpoint_ref` to its endpoint JSON.
3. `PipelineRunner` (`src/runner.py`) translates the resolved contract
   objects into a flat config dict via `_build_config_dict` (and its
   source/destination translation helpers), then constructs a
   `StreamingEngine` with runtime tuning parameters from the pipeline
   config and calls `engine.stream_data(config_dict)`.
4. `StreamingEngine.stream_data` creates one `StreamProcessor`
   (`src/engine/stream_processor.py`) per stream and runs them
   concurrently. Each processor owns everything scoped to its stream —
   counters, the gRPC client, its dead letter queue — and runs four async
   stages — `_extract_stage -> _transform_stage -> _load_stage ->
   _checkpoint_stage` — wired together with async queues. The transform
   stage compiles the assignment AST once (`compile_transform`) and applies
   it to each batch as vectorized Arrow compute.
5. `_load_stage` streams batches over gRPC to the destination service
   with row-level, content-derived idempotency (protocol in
   [`grpc-streaming-architecture.md`](grpc-streaming-architecture.md)).
   Every send — including the synthetic empty batch that truncates a
   zero-batch full refresh — goes through one shared send/ack/retry loop
   (`_send_batch_acked`), so retry backoff and ack handling behave
   identically everywhere; only the failure policy (fail/dlq/skip,
   classification) differs per call site.
6. Metrics snapshots are emitted to logs as `ANALITIQ_METRICS::{...}`
   lines (batch-level from the engine, pipeline-level from the runner)
   and final pipeline metrics are persisted via
   `state.metrics_storage.save_pipeline_metrics`.

## Exception Hierarchy

Defined in `src/engine/exceptions.py`:

```
StreamProcessingError                   (base for runtime stream failures)
├── TransformationError
├── ConnectorError
└── StreamExecutionError                (carries stage + batch context)

ConfigurationError                      (base for config-time failures)
├── StreamConfigurationError
├── PipelineValidationError
└── StageConfigurationError
```

Concurrent stream failures are aggregated with Python 3.11+
`ExceptionGroup` and consumed in callers via `except*`.

```python
try:
    await engine.stream_data(pipeline_config)
except* StreamProcessingError as eg:
    for exc in eg.exceptions:
        logger.error("stream failed: %s", exc)
except* Exception as eg:
    for exc in eg.exceptions:
        logger.error("unexpected error: %s", exc)
```

## Pipeline Error Codes (customer-safe contract)

The pipeline-level metrics record (`state.metrics_storage.PipelineMetricsRecord`,
emitted as `ANALITIQ_METRICS::{"type":"pipeline",...}`) carries a stable,
machine-readable failure category alongside `status` and the counts. The engine
classifies the terminating exception — it is the only layer that sees the
failure's stage and side at the raise site — using
`state.error_classification.classify_exception`.

`ErrorCode` is a **published contract**. The control plane forwards it to
external, API-key customers via the public run-status endpoint, so values are
stable: add members as new failure semantics appear, never rename or repurpose
existing ones. Coordinate additions with the control plane's error-code catalog.

| `error_code` | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `SOURCE_AUTH_FAILED` | Authentication/credentials to the source were rejected |
| `SOURCE_UNREACHABLE` | Source could not be reached (offline, DNS, refused, timeout) |
| `DESTINATION_WRITE_FAILED` | Writing to / reaching the destination failed (incl. a transport-side handshake failure) |
| `RATE_LIMITED` | Source rate-limited / throttled the request |
| `CONFIG_INVALID` | Pipeline/connector/connection config invalid — incl. type-map / mapping defects and destination schema-configuration failures |
| `INTERNAL` | Anything not matched above (treated as an engine-side fault) |

There is deliberately no `SCHEMA_MISMATCH` code: the engine performs no schema
validation. The destination "schema" handshake (`configure_schema`) only prepares
the destination's own table via DDL, so a failed handshake is a destination
*configuration* defect (`CONFIG_INVALID`) or a transport failure
(`DESTINATION_WRITE_FAILED`) — never a data-vs-schema mismatch. Type-map misses
and mapping/transform errors are likewise configuration defects.

Three error fields appear on the record, with distinct audiences:

- `error_code` — the enum above. Customer-safe. Set on `failed` (and `partial`
  where a dominant cause exists); `None` on success.
- `error_message` — a short, fixed, per-code human-readable message. Carries no
  exception text, so it cannot leak secrets, driver internals, or stack traces.
  Customer-safe.
- `error_detail` — a structured failure summary built from allowlisted-safe
  tokens only: stage labels, error codes, and exception *class names* read off
  the live objects (`stage/CODE:ExceptionType`), never message text. It is safe
  by construction — no driver internals, query fragments, or credentials can
  appear, so there is nothing to scrub. **Internal-only** nonetheless: the
  control plane must not forward it externally. The full message text stays in
  the engine logs.

Classification is **structured-first**. The engine stamps a `FailureTag` (a
definite `(error_code, stage)`) on the exception at the raise site, where it
already knows the stage and side: the extract / transform / load stage
boundaries, the destination handshake, and the config phase. `classify_exception`
reads those tags and uses them verbatim — deterministic, no text matching. For an
aggregated `ExceptionGroup` (every stream failed) the highest-priority tag across
the leaves wins, and `error_detail` keeps every per-stream leaf rather than
collapsing to `All streams failed (N sub-exceptions)`.

Three structured signals cross process boundaries so the tag survives isolation:

- The source worker's `deterministic` flag (a config/contract error retrying
  cannot heal) is preserved across the gRPC worker boundary as a `CONFIG_INVALID`
  tag, so a deterministic source-config error classifies as `CONFIG_INVALID`
  regardless of the `ReadError`/`RuntimeError` wrapper its type collapses into.
- The destination-handshake reason (engine/proxy-generated, including the inner
  reason forwarded across the worker proxy) is split transport-vs-config at the
  raise site by `classify_handshake_failure`, so a proxied destination outage
  classifies `DESTINATION_WRITE_FAILED` and a destination-config defect
  `CONFIG_INVALID` — no schema-vs-transport guessing.
- The batch ack's `FailureCategory` (`BatchAck` field 9, issue #351): the
  destination declares config-defect / write-rejected / not-ready where the
  failure is caught, and `classify_destination_failure` maps the declared
  category directly (`CONFIG_INVALID` / `DESTINATION_WRITE_FAILED` /
  `INTERNAL`) instead of substring-matching the `failure_summary` prose.

A connector may declare its driver's failure taxonomy as data — the
`error_map` block in `connector.json` (issue #401): SQLSTATE classes and
states, exception class names, vendor codes, HTTP statuses, each mapped to
an engine-owned category (`transient | config | auth | unreachable |
rate_limited | write_rejected`). The engine alone derives the verdicts
(`AckStatus`, `FailureCategory`, `ErrorCode`, backoff) from a declared
category; connectors never self-declare verdicts. Every classification
site consults the declared map first, so a declaring connector gets
deterministic classification for declared identifiers with zero connector
Python.

The name/phrase heuristics remain in three narrow roles only, each running
strictly after the declared map and the structured signals, and each logs
when it decided: the **source-extract fine split**
(`classify_source_extract`), which picks auth-vs-unreachable-vs-rate for an
opaque, undeclared source driver/HTTP error; the **destination-load
fallback** (`classify_destination_failure`) for a batch failure whose ack
declares no category — a thick connector's own ack, or a failure with no
ack at all; and a defensive **fallback** (`classify_exception` over class
names + message text, mirroring `cdk.sql._adbc_utils._is_fatal_adbc_error`)
for any exception that reaches the runner with no tag. Because the source
split runs *only* at the source boundary, a destination port (`host:401`)
or path can never be misread as source auth.

The `error_code` enum is the stable, audited contract. The one residual
best-effort area is the source-extract fine split above, and only for a
connector that declares no `error_map`: an un-typed, undeclared source
driver error's auth-vs-unreachable-vs-rate is inferred from its text and can
fall to a neighbouring code or `INTERNAL`. It is never a secret leak (only
class names and codes ever reach `error_detail`) and never a cross-stage
error (the stage is always known from the tag).

## ConnectionRuntime and Transports

Each connection loaded by `PipelineConfigPrep` becomes a
`ConnectionRuntime` (`cdk/cdk/connection_runtime.py`). The runtime:

- Holds the resolved connector definition and the user's connection
  document.
- Requires `connector_type` to be a non-empty string. Which kinds are
  runnable is decided by the worker registry (`cdk/cdk/registry.py`),
  not by a hard-coded set, so registry-discovered connector kinds are
  not blocked at config time.
- When the connector declares a `transports` block, builds the actual
  transport (SQLAlchemy async engine, aiohttp ClientSession, etc.) via
  `cdk/cdk/transport_factory.py`. The factory drives:
  - `_materialize_derived` — fixpoint-evaluates the connector's
    `derived` block.
  - `_ssl_dict_to_context` — builds an `ssl.SSLContext` from declarative
    `{verify_mode, check_hostname}` dicts (CPython-safe ordering).
  - `build_sqlalchemy_transport` and `build_http_transport` — assemble
    the final transport, rejecting half-specified `rate_limit` shapes.
- Reference-counts handles so multiple streams sharing a connection
  share the same engine / session.

Expression resolution (`ref`, `template`, `literal`, `function`) is
provided by `cdk/cdk/resolver.py`; the `function` registry is in
`cdk/cdk/derived_functions.py` (`lookup`, `basic_auth`,
`base64_encode`, `url_encode`).

## Source Connector Layer

`BaseConnector` lives in `src/source/connectors/base.py`. The only
engine-side concrete implementation is `APIConnector`
(`src/source/connectors/api.py`) — it handles cursor / offset / page /
time-window pagination, incremental replication with safety windows and
tie-breaker deduplication, rate limiting, and retry / backoff via
state-layer helpers.

Database sources and destinations are unified in the CDK as
`GenericSQLConnector` (`cdk/cdk/sql/generic.py`), a single class that
implements four capability Protocols from `cdk/cdk/contract.py`
(`Readable` / `Writable` / `Discoverable` / `TableCreator`) and serves
both SQLAlchemy and ADBC transports. The standalone `DatabaseConnector`
and the per-dialect `src/source/drivers/` classes no longer exist. See
[`connector-module-architecture.md`](connector-module-architecture.md)
for the full CDK contract.

## Connector Registries

Connector classes are resolved through `ConnectorRegistry`
(`cdk/cdk/registry.py`), constructed by `build_registries(...)`. There
is no `HandlerRegistry`.

- The **source** registry is built inside the spawned worker subprocess
  (`build_worker_registries` in `src/worker/__init__.py`); the engine
  process holds only the `WorkerReadable` client and never loads
  connector code.
- The **destination** side builds its registry in
  `src/destination/connectors/__init__.py`, exporting
  `destination_registry` and the `get_handler(connector_type)` helper.
  Built-ins map `database -> GenericSQLConnector`, `api`, `file` / `s3`,
  and `stdout`. Externally installed connector packages register
  themselves through the `analitiq.destination_connectors` entry-point
  group.

## Structured Logging

`StreamingEngine` uses structured logging with correlation IDs. The engine
stamps each log with the `run_id` so batches and stream events are joinable
downstream.

```text
... INFO  src.engine.engine.wise-to-postgresql - Starting pipeline: wise-to-postgresql
... INFO  src.engine.engine.wise-to-postgresql - Processing stream: wise-transfers
       {"stream_id": "wise-transfers", "correlation_id": "..."}
```
